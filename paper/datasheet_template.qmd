Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets.


**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The dataset "Upper income limit, income share and average income by economic family type and income decile" was created to provide insights into income distribution across different economic family types and income deciles in Canada. The dataset aims to analyze the upper income limit, income share, and average income within each economic family type and income decile, offering a detailed understanding of income disparities and trends over time. The creation of this dataset likely aimed to address the gap in comprehensive data on income distribution, particularly at a granular level by economic family type and income decile.
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - The dataset was created by the Statistics Canada, and it was also published by Statistics Canada on the Open Government Portal of Canada.
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - he creation of the dataset was funded by the government of Canada.
4. *Any other comments?*
    - The source of the dataset is the Canadian Income Survey.


**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- The instances in this dataset represent various economic family types and income deciles in Canada. Each instance corresponds to a specific combination of economic family type and income decile, providing insights into income distribution patterns across different socio-economic groups.
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- The original dataset has 183043 instances. 
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset likely contains a sample of instances rather than all possible instances within the population of economic family types and income deciles in Canada. The sample is likely representative of the larger population, ensuring coverage of diverse socio-economic groups and geographic regions.
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance is consist of the year, place, family type, income type, income value of the corresponding group of people of Canada.
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- NO
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- There are some information about income value from some instances because they are unavailable in the original dataset.
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- Relationships between individual instances may be implicit, with connections between economic family types and income deciles inferred from the dataset structure. For example, higher income deciles may be associated with specific economic family types, reflecting income disparities.
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- Recommended data splits may include training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate model performance in predicting income distribution patterns. These splits ensure robustness and generalizability of models trained on the dataset.
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Errors, noise, or redundancies in the dataset may arise from data collection inconsistencies, reporting errors, or sampling biases. Data preprocessing techniques such as outlier detection and data cleaning may be employed to address these issues.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- The dataset is linked to the Canadian Income Survey that is conducted annually.
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The data is protected by confidentiality rules that prevent individuals from being identified.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- No
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- Yes, the dataset contains sub-populations by geographical location, family type, etc. The distribution is even.
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- NO
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The dataset contain income statistics of different groups of Canadians which might be considered sensitive.
16. *Any other comments?*
	- NO

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
	- The data associated with each instance in the Canadian Income Survey (CIS) is acquired through a combination of direct reporting by subjects and the merging of data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and tax records. Subjects provide information on various aspects such as labour market activity, income sources, household characteristics, and geographic details.
2. *What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (for example, hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?*
	- Data collection mechanisms include survey questionnaires for direct reporting by subjects, administrative records for tax data, and automated data processing systems for merging and validating datasets. Validation processes ensure data accuracy and consistency across sources.
3. *If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (for example, deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?*
	- The CIS dataset is a sample drawn from the larger population of Canadians. The sampling strategy is probabilistic, designed to ensure representativeness across demographic groups and geographic regions. Sampling methods are validated to ensure robustness and reliability of survey estimates.
4. *Who was involved in the data collection process (for example, students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (for example, how much were crowdworkers paid)?*
	- Data collection involves collaboration among various stakeholders including government agencies responsible for conducting surveys, data collection personnel, and statistical experts. Data collection staff are trained to administer surveys and ensure compliance with ethical standards.
5. *Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (for example, recent crawl of old news articles)? If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created.*
	- The timeframe for data collection typically spans from January to June of the year following the reference year. This timeframe aligns with the reference period for income and demographic information collected through surveys and tax records.
6. *Were any ethical review processes conducted (for example, by an institutional review board)? If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.*
	- Ethical review processes are conducted by institutional review boards to ensure compliance with privacy regulations and ethical guidelines. These processes evaluate the survey methodology, data collection procedures, and potential risks to participants.
7. *Did you collect the data from the individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (for example, websites)?*
	- Data collection is primarily conducted directly from individuals through survey responses. However, tax data is obtained indirectly from government agencies responsible for tax administration and compliance.
8. *Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language of the notification itself.*
	- Participants are notified about data collection through informed consent processes outlined in survey questionnaires and tax forms. Information about data usage, confidentiality, and rights is provided to participants prior to data collection.
9. *Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how consent was requested and provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language to which the individuals consented.*
	- Participants consent to the collection and use of their data by voluntarily completing survey questionnaires and tax forms. Consent language explicitly outlines the purposes of data collection, confidentiality measures, and participant rights.
10. *If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses? If so, please provide a description, as well as a link or other access point to the mechanism (if appropriate).*
	- Consent mechanisms allow participants to revoke their consent at any time by contacting survey administrators or tax authorities. Participants are informed about their rights to withdraw consent and the implications of doing so.
11. *Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects (for example, a data protection impact analysis) been conducted? If so, please provide a description of this analysis, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.*
	- An analysis of the potential impact of the dataset on data subjects is conducted to assess risks and mitigate harms. This includes evaluating privacy risks, confidentiality protections, and potential biases in data collection and analysis.
