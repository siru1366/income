#  Exploring Income Inequality Dynamics in Canada: A Geospatial and Temporal Analysis

## Overview

This paper investigates income inequality in Canada from 1976 to 2021 using data from various surveys. Through exploratory data analysis and regression modeling, we uncover increasing income inequality trends over time and variations across different provinces. Our findings reveal nuanced relationships between temporal trends, regional disparities, and income distribution dynamics. Through rigorous analysis, we uncover three key findings: a consistent rise in income inequality over time, significant regional disparities across provinces, and nuanced interactions between temporal trends and income distribution dynamics. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for policymakers to develop targeted strategies aimed at mitigating income inequality and promoting social and economic equity in Canada.
## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from Statistique Canda.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper and datasheet, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper and datasheet. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, and clean data and build models.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the auto-complete tool, Codriver. The abstract and introduction were written with the help of ChatHorse and the entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
